Djangoâ€™s default behaviour is to run in autocommit mode, By default each query is immediately committed to the database, 
each SQL query gets wrapped in its own transaction and a transaction is automatically committed or rolled back.

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are treated as a unit. All operations should be executed successfully in order to call the transaction successful. 
Transactions ideally have four properties, commonly known as ACID. 
This is a standard set of properties aimed to guarantee database transactions are processed reliably which is especially concerned with how a database recovers from any failure.

Atomicity is the defining property of database transactions. Atomic require us to create a block of code within which the atomicity on the database is guaranteed.
